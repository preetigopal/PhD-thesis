		Computed tomography (CT) enables visualization of the internal
		  structure of an object without cutting it
		  open. This is extremely useful and finds extensive applications in
		  medicine, for instance, to observe the changes in the internal
		  anatomy.  It is also used to visualize the internal structure of
		  plant specimens, as well as in the fault detection of fabricated objects in the
		  manufacturing sector. While it is true that there is no explicit physical damage, CT does
		  require passing a uniform beam of X-rays through an object from multiple directions as shown below.

		 <p> Differences in the local absorption of the X-rays convey information 
		  about the internal object density variations.	High intensity
		  X-rays sent from a large number of directions -- theoretically
		  infinite -- enables excellent clarity of the internals.  However,
		  reducing the exposure to these rays has always been sought after in order to prevent the specimen
		  from damage, especially if it is being imaged multiple times over an
		  extended time duration. For this reason, <b>one may either reduce the
		  number of directions along which rays are passed (few-view) or
		  reduce the intensity (low-dose) of rays or apply both of
		  these</b>. In such cases, the inverse reconstruction problem becomes
		  ill-posed and it is challenging to reconstruct the 3D object with
		  details of sufficient diagnostic quality.

                <p> The figure below shows the kind of artefacts that appear when reconstructing from few-view and low-dose measurements.</p>

		  This thesis aims to reduce the above artefacts by using <b>data-driven (prior-based)</b> techniques within the widely used <b>Compressed Sensing (CS)</b> framework, for each of the above scenarios: 			  few-view imaging and low-dose imaging. We specifically focus on 
                  reconstructing in <b>longitudinal studies</b> i.e., when repeated scans of an object are taken to study the changes within it over a period of 			  time. The figure below gives a outline of where our work fits in within the imaging and reconstruction pipeline.

		<p> In conventional data acquisition techniques, measurements are acquired by sampling the physical object uniformly above the Nyquist rate.  
		In few-view imaging, the measurements are taken from an exceedingly small number of
		views; however, these are with standard strength X-rays, i.e., the
		intensity of each beam is kept to current practices. We present two techniques to significantly reduce the reconstruction artefacts due to few-view imaging: </p>

              </ul>

              <h4 id="grouping_measurements" style="color:brown;">Grouping measurements</h4>
		<p>Here, we show that if measurements from different views of two
		similar objects are combined, then the reconstructions of both the
		objects improve. This is due the presence of additional information
		than would have otherwise not been utilized had the two objects been
		reconstructed from their respective measurements. </p>
              <center><img src="images/few_views_tomography/grouping_process.png" width="920" height="300" align="middle"></img></center>

	      <h4 id="few-view-prior" style="color:brown;">Using Unweighted and weighted global priors</h4>
	      <p>Next, we deal with the case of longitudinal studies, wherein an object
		is imaged multiple times to observe the changes it undergoes over a
		period of time. Given previous good quality scans of an object
		(``templates''), we reconstruct the current data from its few-view
		measurements. A sample result on CT of Humerus bone is shown below:</p>
		<center><img src="images/few_views_tomography/FBP_CS_Ours.png" width="750" height="200" align="middle" Vspace="30"></img></center>
		<p>An overview of our method is shown below. The choice of the number of measurement views and the type of reconstruction is driven by the goal in any 			application.  When our goal is simple-- to track the location of new changes while simultaneously reducing sub-sampling artefacts, we propose to (a) capture 			measurements from few views (`few-view' imaging) and use unweighted prior-based reconstruction. When our goal becomes more ambitious-- to observe details of 			the new changes while simultaneously reducing sub-sampling artefacts, we propose to  (b) capture measurements from a slightly higher number of views 			(`moderate-view' imaging) and use weighted prior-based reconstruction.</p>

              	In low-dose imaging, the measurements are taken with reduced strength X-rays,
		i.e., the intensity of each beam is kept far below  current practices.

		Traditional low dose reconstructions are noisy due to the dominance of
		Poisson noise during aquisition. We use a new convolution based method
		to reconstruct from low dose measurements and compare its performance
		with existing methods. Further, in cases where previous regular
		standard dose based scans of an object are available, we apply the
		prior based technique to detect inliers or regions of new changes from
		low dose measurements. Once the inliers are detected, this information
		is appropriately used 
		to again enhance the reconstruction with improved sensitivity to changes over any altered regions.

              <p> Finally, all of the previous processes use projected views to reconstruct 
		images as a local regional intensity estimate for each discrete image 
		pixel or voxel. Acquiring measurements along a direction corresponds to 
		sampling a few frequencies from the spectrum of the imaged object.
		In this context,  we also show that under-sampled frequency domain data can be 
		processed  to  partially interpolate missing values to further improve 
		the quality of the reconstructed images. An oveview of our technique is shown below:</p>
